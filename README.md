# stepper-motor-control-using-stm32
This project demonstrates precise control of a 4-wire stepper motor using an STM32 microcontroller and the A4988 stepper motor driver. Programmed using STM32CubeIDE, the system generates accurate step pulses and direction control signals through configured GPIO pins.
