# stepper-motor-control-using-stm32
This project demonstrates precise control of a 4-wire stepper motor using an STM32 microcontroller and the A4988 stepper motor driver. Programmed using STM32CubeIDE, the system generates accurate step pulses and direction control signals through configured GPIO pins.
The project involved setting up STM32 timers, controlling step sequences, and managing direction input to achieve smooth rotation and positional accuracy. It serves as a fundamental building block for motor control in robotics and automation systems.
